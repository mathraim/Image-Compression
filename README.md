# Image-Compression
Implemented from scratch K_means and PCA algorithms for image compression in matlab

In this exercise, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch and applied it to compress an image. 
In the second part, I implemented principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
